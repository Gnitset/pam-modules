* Introduction

PAM-modules is a collection of some (hopefully) useful PAM
modules. This file contains brief information about configuring and
using them. It is *not* intended as a replacement for the
documentation, it is provided as a brief reference only. The complete 
documentation for PAM-modules is available in doc/ subdirectory. To
read it without installing the package run `info -f
doc/pam-modules'. After installation, the documentation can be accessed
running `info pam-modules'. 

The online copy of the documentation in various formats is available
at http://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/software/pam-modules/manual.

* Installation

To install the package, do

**  ./configure [options]

For the list of available options consult file INSTALL.
The applications-specific options are:

 --enable-debug
        Enable additional debugging code. See description of the
        `waitdebug' option in node `Introduction to PAM-modules' of
        the documentation.
	
 --with-pamdir=DIR
	Set installation directory for PAM loadable files.
	Default is PREFIX/lib/security.

 --with-crypt-lib=NAME
        Use libNAME instead of libcrypt.  Use this if you wish to use
        an external implementation of crypt(3).  For example, a common
        approach is to use libxcrypt, which provides a wider range of
	encryption algorithms than the native crypt.  To use it, one
	would do the following:

	   ./configure --with-crypt-lib=xcrypt

--without-crypt-lib
        Do not link libcrypt.  This option is provided for the sake of
	really hard cases, when the user wants to supply an
        alternative implementation of crypt, yet finds that
	--with-crypt-lib is not enough for this.  It is supposed that
	the necessary libraries will be given in LDFLAGS variable,
        e.g.:

	   ./configure --without-crypt-lib LDFLAGS=...
	   
 --disable-fshadow
        Disable pam_fshadow module.
	
 --disable-log
        Disable pam_log module.
	
 --disable-regex
        Disable pam_regex module.  
	
 --without-mysql
        Do not build pam_mysql

 --without-pgsql
 --without-postgres
        Do not build pam_pgsql

 --without-sql
        Do not build SQL-dependent modules (i.e. pam_mysql and
        pam_pgsql)

 --with-pamdir=DIR
	Install PAM modiles in DIR (default is PREFIX/lib/security)
	
** Run make

** Run make install
