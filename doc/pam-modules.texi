@chapter Introduction to PAM-modules

     PAM-modules is a collection of useful @acronym{PAM
modules}.  It includes modules for user authentication and logging.

     All modules from the package support the following command line
arguments:

@anchor{common options}
@table @option
@item debug[=@var{level}]
     Change debugging level (0 <= @var{level} <= 100).  The debugging
information will be logged via @code{syslog} channel
@code{auth.debug}.  Notice, that debugging output can reveal
authentication credentials (user password, in particular). 

@item waitdebug[=@var{interval}]
     Enter a dead loop.  This option is intended for
the package developers and is not enabled unless you configure
the package with symbol @code{DEBUG_MODE} defined.  Most probably you
will not need it.  The following description is provided in case you
decide to participate in further development:

     When this option is present, the module displays the
following diagnostics in @command{syslog} @code{auth.crit} channel:

@smallexample
WAITING FOR DEBUG AT pam_regex.c:240
@end smallexample

@noindent
and waits for @var{interval} seconds (default 3600).  The developer is
supposed to attach to the process with a debugger, set @var{interval}
variable to 0 and to continue execution of the module in the debugging
mode. 
@end table

     The following chapters discuss each module in detail.  The reader is
expected to be sufficiently proficient with general @acronym{UNIX}
administration issues and with Pluggable Authentication Modules
(@acronym{PAM}) in particular.

@node fshadow, regex, Intro, Top
@chapter pam_fshadow

@cindex pam_fshadow
     This module provides authentication against an alternative
@file{shadow} file (or @file{passwd} / @file{shadow} pair).  It takes
following options:

@table @option
@item nopasswd
     Do not require passwd file to be present.
     
@item sysconfdir=@var{dir}
     Set full name of the directory where @file{shadow} and
@file{passwd} are located.  By default the system configuration
directory will be used.  It is set when configuring the package and
defaults to @file{@var{prefix}/etc}.

@item use_authtok	
     Do not prompt the user for password, take it from the saved
authentication tokens.  This option is useful when @command{pam_fshadow}
is used as a non-first module in a stack of authentication modules.
@end table

     The following example illustrates the use of
@command{pam_fshadow} in @file{pam.conf} file:

@smallexample
tuhs auth  requisite  pam_radius.so
tuhs auth  required   pam_fshadow.so \
                      sysconfdir=/home/tuhs/tuhs/etc nopasswd use_authtok
@end smallexample

@node regex, log, fshadow, Top
@chapter pam_regex

@cindex pam_regex
     The module @command{pam_regex} allows to control user access by
matching their login name against the given regular expression.  It
is useful in authentication stacks for such services as
@acronym{FTP} or @acronym{HTTP}. 
     
@table @code
@item basic
     Use basic regular expression.
     
@item case
     Use case-insensitive regular expression.

@item extended
     Use extended regular expression.
            
@item icase
     Use case-insensitive regular expression.
     
@item regex=@var{string}
     The user name must match the given regular expression.  This
option is mandatory.  The default expression flavor is
``basic, case-sensitive'', but this can be changed using other
options (see above).

@item sense=@{allow|deny@}
     What to do if user name matches the regexp.  Default is @samp{allow}.

@item use_authtok	
     Do not prompt the user for password, take it from the saved
authentication tokens.  This option is useful when @command{pam_fshadow}
is used as a non-first module in a stack of authentication modules.

@item user=@var{string}
     Upon successful matching, return set PAM user name to @var{string}.

@end table

     Here's an example of using this module:
     
@smallexample
httpd auth  required  pam_regex.so sense=deny regex=.*@@.*
@end smallexample

@noindent
this example denies login for users whose login names contain the
@samp{@@} character.

@node log, sql, regex, Top
@chapter Log arbitrary messages to syslog.

     The @command{pam_log} logs is a diagnostic tool.  It works as the
shell @command{echo} command, outputting its arguments to the
@command{syslog}.  The module can be used in any PAM service
stack.

     Before logging, each argument is subject to @dfn{variable
substitiution}.  During this phase, any occurrence of
@code{$@var{variable}} is substituted by the value of @var{variable}.
If the @var{variable} is not defined, emtpy string is substituted
instead.  The shell-style default values are also supported: the
notation @code{$@{@var{variable}:-@var{value}@}} expands to the value
of @var{variable} if it is set, and to @var{value} otherwise.

     Supported variables are:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .50
@headitem Variable name @tab PAM variable
@item service @tab PAM_SERVICE 
@item user    @tab PAM_USER 
@item tty     @tab PAM_TTY 
@item rhost   @tab PAM_RHOST 
@item ruser   @tab PAM_RUSER 
@item prompt  @tab PAM_USER_PROMPT
@item password @tab PAM_AUTHTOK
@end multitable

     In order to be discerned from the arguments, all @command{pam_log}'s
options begin with a dash (@samp{-}).  They must precede the
non-option arguments.  If the first non-option argument happens to
begin with a dash, you can inhibit its special handling by placing
@samp{--} before it.

     The following table lists all the supported options:

@table @option
@item -debug[=@var{level}]
Similar to @option{debug} in other modules (@pxref{Intro}).

@item -no-open

@item -waitdebug[=@var{interval}]
Similar to @option{waitdebug} in other modules (@pxref{Intro}).

@item -pri=@var{facility}.@var{priority}
Requests to send log messages to the given syslog facility and
priority.  The @var{facility} part can be any of: @samp{user},
@samp{daemon}, @samp{auth}, @samp{authpriv}, @samp{local0}, @samp{local1},
@samp{local2}, @samp{local3}, @samp{local4}, @samp{local5}, @samp{local6},
@samp{local7}. 

     The @var{priority} is any of the following: @samp{emerg}, @samp{alert}, 
@samp{crit}, @samp{err}, @samp{warning}, @samp{notice}, @samp{info},
@samp{debug}. 

     Either @var{facility} or @var{priority} can be omitted, in which case
the following defaults are used: @var{facility}=@code{authpriv},
@var{priority}=@code{info}.

@item -tag=@var{label}
Use @var{label} as the syslog tag, instead of the module name.
@end table

     The following example illustrates the use of this module:

@smallexample
@group
cvs auth       required  pam_regex.so extended \
    regex=(anoncvs|anonymous) sense=allow 
cvs account    requisite pam_log.so -tag CVS-ACCESS \
    -pri=daemon.info User $@{user:-unknown@} is granted CVS access
cvs account    required   pam_permit.so
cvs session    required   pam_permit.so
@end group
@end smallexample

@node sql, Reporting Bugs, log, Top
@chapter Simple SQL authentication.

     The package provides two modules for SQL authentication:
@command{pam_mysql}, for MySQL and @command{pam_pgsql} for
PostgreSQL.  Both modules share the same set of options and provide
similar functionality.  To authenticate the user, the module connects
to the database and issues a query which should return the user
password.  Then the obtained password is compared with the
authentication token, using a preconfigured algorithm.  If it matches,
the user is authenticated successfully. 

     The options, common for both modules are:

@table @option
@item use_authtok	
     Do not prompt the user for password, take it from the saved
authentication tokens.  This option is useful when this module is
not the first in the stack of authentication modules.

@item config=@var{file}
     Read SQL access credentials from the given @var{file}.
@end table

     The configuration file has a simple line-oriented syntax.  Empty
lines and lines beginning with @samp{#} are ignored.  Nonempty lines
consist of the keyword and its value, separated by any amount of the
white space.

     The keywords, common for both modules are:

@table @code
@item host @var{hostname}
Defines the host where the database is running.

@item port @var{number}
Defines the SQL port number.

@item db @var{database}
Sets the database name.

@item login @var{string}
Sets the SQL user name.

@item pass @var{password}
Sets the SQL user password

@item query @var{query}
Defines the query used to obtain the user's password from the
database.  The query can contain the following meta-characters:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .40
@headitem Meta-char @tab Replaced by
@item %u @tab User name
@item %p @tab User password (authentication token)
@item %% @tab Literal @samp{%} character
@end multitable

@end table

     Variables, specific for @command{pam_pgsql}:

@table @code
@item allow-plaintext-pass @var{bool}
The returned password can be plaintext.  Without this option, it is
supposed to be encrypted using the system @code{crypt} function.
@end table

     Variables, specific for @command{pam_mysql}:
     
@table @code
@item allow-mysql-pass @var{bool}
The returned password can be encrypted using MySQL @code{password}
function.

@item allow-plaintext-pass @var{bool}
The returned password can be plaintext.
@end table
