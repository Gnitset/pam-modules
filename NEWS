Version 1.3.90 (SVN)

* pam_mysql and pam_pgsql

** Session management

Session management is implemented for both modules.  Session
management queries are `session-start-query' and `session-stop-query'.

** Variable expansion in configuration file.

Old style of variable expansion has been dropped.  The `$name'
notation is used instead.  To convert your old configuration files,
replace %u with $user, and %p with $password.



Version 1.3, 2008-03-15

* pam_mysql and pam_pgsql

** Configuration file syntax

Long statements can be split over several lines by placing
'\' character at the end of each line.

** ldap passwords

Both modules understand passwords in LDAP form.  A special
configuration file statement `allow-ldap-pass' is provided to control
this feature.  By default, `allow-ldap-pass yes' is assumed.
