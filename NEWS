Version 1.7.92, Git

* pam_ldaphome
* pam_umotd


Version 1.7, 2011-04-08

* Allow for use of `CALL proc' in MySQL queries.
* Minor bugfixes in pamck.


Version 1.6, 2009-02-25

* pamck

Pamck is a command line utility for checking PAM authentication and
other management groups.  E.g.:

   pamck -s login smith

attempts to authenticate user `smith' using PAM service name `login'.


Version 1.5, 2009-02-17

* Configure

New command line options:

  --disable-fshadow
  --disable-log
  --disable-regex

Improved autodetection of MySQL and PostgreSQL libraries.

Missing prerequisites for any module cause disabling of that module,
but the configuration process continues.


Version 1.4, 2008-03-20

* pam_mysql and pam_pgsql

** Session management

Session management is implemented for both modules.  Session
management queries are `session-start-query' and `session-stop-query'.

** Variable expansion in configuration file.

Old style of variable expansion has been dropped.  The `$name'
notation is used instead.  To convert your old configuration files,
replace %u with $user, and %p with $password.

** setenv-query

This new query allows to store arbitrary data in PAM environment.


Version 1.3, 2008-03-15

* pam_mysql and pam_pgsql

** Configuration file syntax

Long statements can be split over several lines by placing
'\' character at the end of each line.

** ldap passwords

Both modules understand passwords in LDAP form.  A special
configuration file statement `allow-ldap-pass' is provided to control
this feature.  By default, `allow-ldap-pass yes' is assumed.


Version 1.2, 2008-03-14

* Several fixes in debugging code and pam_mysql, pam_pgsql modules.

* pam_fshadow

By default extended regular expressions are used. 

* pam_regex transform=expr

New command line option `transform' allows to rewrite user names.


Version 1.1, 2007-08-11

* pam_fshadow allows to use virtual domains to specify alternate password
databases.  New options: regex, basic, extended, ignore-case, icase
and revert-index.

* pam_regex: ignore-case can be used as an alias to icase.

* New modules

pam_log                 Log arbitrary data
pam_mysql		Authenticate using a MySQL database
pam_pgsql		Authenticate using a PostgreSQL database


Version 1.0

	Added documentation, improved configuration suite.
