Version 1.9.90 (Git)

* pam_ldaphome reads LDAP configuration from /etc/ldap.conf

This is in addition to its regular configuration file.


Version 1.9, 2014-05-21

* New module pam_groupmember

Tests whether the user is a member of one or more groups.

* pam_ldaphome can invoke an external program

An external program defined with the inirc-command keyword is run
in the newly created user's home directory.  It can be used for
per-user customization of the files copied from the skeleton dir.

The examples directory contains a perl program "usergitconfig", which,
when used as inirc-command, initializes the user's .gitconfig file.

* New auxiliary utilities

** ldappubkey

The `ldappubkey' utility is a simple Perl program which takes user
login name as its argument and produces on the standard output public
ssh keys for that user, each on a separate line.  The program is
designed for use with `openssh' version 6.2p1 or higher.

** usergitconfig

Customizes user's `.gitconfig' file using attributes from his LDAP
entry.  This utility can be used with the initrc-command statement
in pam_ldaphome.conf file.

* Bugfixes


Version 1.8, 2013-07-29

* pam_ldaphome

This module creates the user home directory, if it does not
already exist, and updates his `.ssh/authorized_keys' file with the
keys from the LDAP database.

* pam_umotd

Pam_umotd displays a user-specific message of the day.  The text can
be taken either from a disk file, or read from the standard output of
a program launched for that purpose.  This module is Linux-specific.

* Bugfixes
** pam_fshadow made reentrant



Version 1.7, 2011-04-08

* Allow for use of `CALL proc' in MySQL queries.
* Minor bugfixes in pamck.


Version 1.6, 2009-02-25

* pamck

Pamck is a command line utility for checking PAM authentication and
other management groups.  E.g.:

   pamck -s login smith

attempts to authenticate user `smith' using PAM service name `login'.


Version 1.5, 2009-02-17

* Configure

New command line options:

  --disable-fshadow
  --disable-log
  --disable-regex

Improved autodetection of MySQL and PostgreSQL libraries.

Missing prerequisites for any module cause disabling of that module,
but the configuration process continues.


Version 1.4, 2008-03-20

* pam_mysql and pam_pgsql

** Session management

Session management is implemented for both modules.  Session
management queries are `session-start-query' and `session-stop-query'.

** Variable expansion in configuration file.

Old style of variable expansion has been dropped.  The `$name'
notation is used instead.  To convert your old configuration files,
replace %u with $user, and %p with $password.

** setenv-query

This new query allows to store arbitrary data in PAM environment.


Version 1.3, 2008-03-15

* pam_mysql and pam_pgsql

** Configuration file syntax

Long statements can be split over several lines by placing
'\' character at the end of each line.

** ldap passwords

Both modules understand passwords in LDAP form.  A special
configuration file statement `allow-ldap-pass' is provided to control
this feature.  By default, `allow-ldap-pass yes' is assumed.


Version 1.2, 2008-03-14

* Several fixes in debugging code and pam_mysql, pam_pgsql modules.

* pam_fshadow

By default extended regular expressions are used. 

* pam_regex transform=expr

New command line option `transform' allows to rewrite user names.


Version 1.1, 2007-08-11

* pam_fshadow allows to use virtual domains to specify alternate password
databases.  New options: regex, basic, extended, ignore-case, icase
and revert-index.

* pam_regex: ignore-case can be used as an alias to icase.

* New modules

pam_log                 Log arbitrary data
pam_mysql		Authenticate using a MySQL database
pam_pgsql		Authenticate using a PostgreSQL database


Version 1.0

	Added documentation, improved configuration suite.


Version 0.1

	Initial release. See README for short description.
